# CS2_HW9

You will do this homework in teams of 3-4 students.  Try to pick students you have not worked with before.

## Introduction
In class this week we are beginning to discuss graphs, a type of data structure that represents nodes in the form of vertices and edges that connect them.  There are other variations on graphs that deal with other situations.  One example is a bipartite graph.  This is generally a graph where you can divide the vertices into two separate but independent groups.  Oftentimes, in a bipartite graph you can only have edges between the members of the two independent sets (you do not have links within a set).  Bipartite graphs are often visualized as two sets of vertices and links between them:

You might, for example, have a bipartite graph with stores as one set of vertices and the products they sell as the other set of vertices.

So, your group should come up with a data structure that you believe would allow you to represent a bipartite graph.  If you are looking at the code used in class you could imagine that the files describing a bipartite graph always list the vertex from the first set on the left and the second set on the right, with links between them.

## What to Submit
Submit your solution as a code file. Give the file the name AssignmentTypeNumberLastNameFirstName.cpp (so, for example, my submission for Homework 3 would be named Homework3MaclinRichard.txt). You should also include your first and last name in the file and the names of your teammates. Your code does not have to run, but you may consider testing your code to demonstrate that your solution is correct.
